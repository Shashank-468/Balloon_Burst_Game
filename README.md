Balloon Burst Game is an interactive game which is used for colour identification. It was my project which i have done for my university. In this firstly I have to choose colour and then I have to pop maximum balloons of that colour in 3 levels and after that it will display degree of attentiveness. Duration of first level is 60 seconds, second level is 30 second, and the third one is 15 seconds. It is made up of HTML, CSS, JavaScript and some BootStrap Libraries.
