Ballon Pop Game is an interactive game which is used for colour identification. It was my project which i have done for my university. In this firstly I have to choose colour and then I have to pop maximum balloons of that colour which I have selected in 1 minute or we can say in 60 seconds. It is made up of HTML, CSS, JavaScript and some BootStrap Libraries.
